There's plenty to think about, locked inside your bedroom.

## Summary

with a not-so-strange arrangement of furniture and plenty of latent thoughts to be had, maneuver our human friend through their room and accopmanying thoughts as you interact with items and take a tour of their mind. There are several narrative threads divulging at different points, from 4 root stories. Can you piece them each together?


## Timeline

Week 1: conceived of project & interaction patterns.

Week 2: designed the map, began writing narrative/thematic threads, identified & began to write necessary logic.

Week 3: completed writing story content, finalized map placement and coloring, completed body of code, & added start screen.

Week 4: polish & presentations!


## Challenges

The organization of necessary flag varaibles and rhe timing of their transitions was a primary difficulty, as leaving certain flags open would be allowing the order of text to be distorted or broken entirely. This eventually lead to a narrative reconception as fragmented, nonlinear, and overlapping.
